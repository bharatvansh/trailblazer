# Path Sharing Mod
Players will be able to share their paths with others more effectively if they are able to save their paths and share them, or simply keep them saved for personal use in the future whenever they want.

## Recording Path
Recording on a time basis is not very effective. What if the player doesn’t move or stays still for a few seconds? A better approach is to use distance—recording after a certain distance from the previous marker.

But in our Mod, there should be a different approach. Instead of partial recording, it should record the **whole path**. Players should have the freedom to decide how much they want to record. They should be able to:

- Turn on the path recorder.
- Record as they move.
- Stop recording (and save) whenever they feel done.

There should also be a **shortcut button** to quickly start/stop recording. While recording, the path being created should show live.

## Two Ways of Recording

**1. Shortcut Button**  
- Any shortcut key can be used to start and stop recording.  
- No need to open the menu to begin or end if this method is used.  
- The path should be given an automatic name if no custom name is assigned.

**2. From the Menu**  
- Use the main menu and the button inside it.  
- A custom name can be given to the path (default name if none is given).  
- From the recorded paths menu, players can edit, delete, share, toggle on/off, etc.

**Note:** Starting and ending methods should be flexible. For example, if a player starts recording with the menu but ends with the shortcut key, it should still work smoothly. Both methods should stay linked.

## Showing the Path

Paths could be displayed in three different ways, switchable in the main menu:

1. **Particle Trails** – Instead of markers at intervals, the entire path is shown as a trail of particles. (This is why recording the whole path is necessary.)
2. **Series of Markers** – Markers spaced at intervals (e.g., 3 blocks apart).
3. **Series of Arrows** – Similar to markers, but arrows are used to also show direction.

---

## Main Menu
The main menu should allow players to manage all saved recordings and initiate new ones.

- **Saved Recordings**
  - All saved paths should appear in the menu.
  - Any path can be shared with players in multiplayer.
  - Paths can be toggled ON/OFF. If ON, the path is visible only to the player who turned it on (not others). Each player controls visibility individually.

- **Tabs**
  - **My Paths** – Paths I created and saved.
  - **Shared With Me** – Paths shared with me by other players, tagged with the sharer’s name.

- **Shared Paths Options**
  - Toggle ON/OFF.
  - Forward/share with others.
  - Edit (likely only the name).
  - Delete.

- **Settings Icon**
  - Opens the settings panel with various configuration options.
